Like many of us at the margins of prosperity and possibility, he placed his luck in the hands of the monthly lottery, rationing dinners and spare change for that one-in-a-million draw.
  I imagine what a shock it was when he did win in the end, a hundred dollars in cold, hard cash, enough for a trip out to Santa Cruz. He’d later bus tables and babysit with Aunt Mariana to pay for barbering school. Tito Sora says the vision for Monday Jetty’s was forged in interchanges of cafecito and baby food.  
  He married Mariana on the Rosewalk in 1954, beneath a canopy of late-summer magnolias and blue junipers. I remember by sundown, they were waltzing barefoot in the lower gardens to Dinah Washington. I didn’t sleep that night. Maybe it was the sugar in the fruit punch. Maybe it was the dawning of possibility on the edge of the world. 
  I still go back sometimes, crossing the Bay Bridge in the hazy lure of nighttime. It's mid-June. The electric-yellow sign of Monday Jetty’s peaks out of a dumpster, shoved into the narrow divide between Mervyn’s and AP. Mariana says that love doesn't simply dissipate from the earth like heat on a summer night (We are not houses of stone), but wanders over the grounds of demolished homes and gathers its weary voice on the paths of diaspora, waiting to take root in richer soil. (So go and gather your lost and wind-blown hopes, dandelions with roots grown in the concrete. You are not an island without connection, loveless and isolated beneath the blazing sun.) 
Across the parking lot, a stout man with silver-white hair dozes in the seat of his cherry-red Cadillac. He tosses his cigarette out of his window, dusts the soot off his fine, dark blazer and rushes off into the night. It reminds me that two distinct roads go from here: the north road that leads to cream-white mansions on rose-covered hills, and the road I've been traveling all these years. This is the lesson I've learned: Tuesday follows Monday, the California dream lies just ahead, and we must keep on marching towards the untouchable horizon.
